#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
Welcome on an epic journey in **HACKWARS: THE VULNERABILITIES STRIKE BACK** web application in flask where the goal is to teach about the cybersecurity. This app was created as an final project for Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. It was also created as an Web CTF app challenge for students science club on my university Akademia WIT in Warsaw.

This simple flask Web app presents the user with a handful of challenges in which they must try their best to succeed and hack the website. The main goal is to go into Emperorâ€™s darkarchive page. User will collect on their journey flags which should be used on **/score** page where as they get more flags they will gather more points. For the Science club there will be an option to send me a hash to verify the authenticity of their score.

#### Your Mission

Accept the challenge to join the ranks of Code Jedis. Dive into the world of cybersecurity, master digital ethical hacking, and apply your prowess to overcome the obstacles that await. Navigate through deceptions and traps set by the Sith Hackers. Only those with wisdom and skill will uncover the vulnerabilities and safeguard the Digital Republic.

#### Challenges

- **Social Engineering**: Sharpen your observation skills to gather information and identify patterns that the Sith Hackers use to mislead you.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Learn to utilize XSS techniques to uncover hidden information crucial to your mission.
- **SQL Injection**: Embark on a quest to penetrate the Sith database. Navigate through levels of SQL injections to access a hidden table filled with essential hints.
- **Insufficient Access Control**: Discover API endpoints that lack proper authentication, allowing access to sensitive data without login credentials.

#### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Login Mechanism**: Use your detective skills to piece together hints scattered throughout the site, which are crucial for progressing in your quest. These hints are encrypted and require your analytical skills to decode.
- **Hacking Techniques**: Engage in a variety of hacking activities, from social engineering to exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Scoring System

- **Social Engineering**: Points are awarded for identifying key information and recurring patterns on the site.
- **XSS**: Successfully using XSS to obtain a cookie with a hint scores points.
- **SQL Injection**: Points are given for each level of SQL Injection overcome and for finding the crucial hint table.
- **Insufficient Access Control**: Points are awarded for each unauthorized API endpoint accessed.

Players submit their scores through a special form on the site to see how they rank in their quest to protect the Digital Republic.

### Engage in the Adventure

Prepare for an adventure filled with coding challenges, strategic thinking, and the thrill of cyber combat. As you progress, you'll encounter various hacking techniques designed to test your skills and adaptability.

**May the Secure Code be with you...**
