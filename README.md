# HackWars: The Vulnerabilities Strike Back

## Harvard CS50 Final Project

This project is developed as a final assignment for Harvard University's CS50 course. It is a web application designed to introduce and educate users on the concepts of cybersecurity through an interactive and engaging platform. Players will embark on a journey to protect a digital galaxy from cybersecurity threats, learning about various vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms along the way.

### Introduction

Embark on an epic journey in **HACKWARS: THE VULNERABILITIES STRIKE BACK**, Episode I: The Cyber Menace. In this digital saga, the Digital Republic faces threats from the nefarious Dark Hackers. These adversaries have identified a critical flaw in the Republic's defenses, jeopardizing the safety of systems across the galaxy.

Rise as a Code Jedi, armed with cybersecurity knowledge and skills, to challenge the dark forces of cyber threats. Your quest is to protect the Digital Republic and maintain the balance within the network.

#### Your Mission

Accept the challenge to join the ranks of Code Jedis. Dive into the world of cybersecurity, master digital ethical hacking, and apply your prowess to overcome the obstacles that await. Navigate through deceptions and traps set by the Sith Hackers, who employ deceitful memes and cunning digital riddles to lead you astray. Only those with wisdom and skill will uncover the vulnerabilities and safeguard the Digital Republic.

#### Challenges

- **Social Engineering**: Sharpen your observation skills to gather information and identify patterns that the Sith Hackers use to mislead you.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Learn to utilize XSS techniques to uncover hidden information crucial to your mission.
- **SQL Injection**: Embark on a quest to penetrate the Sith database. Navigate through levels of SQL injections to access a hidden table filled with essential hints.
- **Insufficient Access Control**: Discover API endpoints that lack proper authentication, allowing access to sensitive data without login credentials.

#### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Login Mechanism**: Use your detective skills to piece together hints scattered throughout the site, which are crucial for progressing in your quest. These hints are encrypted and require your analytical skills to decode.
- **Hacking Techniques**: Engage in a variety of hacking activities, from social engineering to exploiting vulnerabilities, to advance through the game.

#### Training and Resources

A dedicated training hub, guided by the wisdom of Master Yoda and Obi-Wan, is available to hone your hacking techniques and prepare you for the challenges that lie ahead.

### Scoring System

- **Social Engineering**: Points are awarded for identifying key information and recurring patterns on the site.
- **XSS**: Successfully using XSS to obtain a cookie with a hint scores points.
- **SQL Injection**: Points are given for each level of SQL Injection overcome and for finding the crucial hint table.
- **Insufficient Access Control**: Points are awarded for each unauthorized API endpoint accessed.

Players submit their scores through a special form on the site to see how they rank in their quest to protect the Digital Republic.

### Engage in the Adventure

Prepare for an adventure filled with coding challenges, strategic thinking, and the thrill of cyber combat. As you progress, you'll encounter various hacking techniques designed to test your skills and adaptability.

**May the Secure Code be with you...**
